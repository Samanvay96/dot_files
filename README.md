# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is allow me to quickly set up my desired tmux and vim themes on new instances.

# Set up Info
## Tmux set-up
Sourced from: https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux

What I like:
 - Use of ctrl + a instead of ctrl + b for key binding prefix. Once you reroute ctrl to caps, the subsequent caps + a bindings speeds up tmux operation.
 - tmux windows start from 1 instead of 0
 - Looks great

## vim set-up
Theme sourced from: https://github.com/tyrannicaltoucan/vim-quantum

What I like:
 - Looks amazing
